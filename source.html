<h1>Terminology</h1>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked
non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

<p>The key words “<em class=rfc2119>MUST</em>”<!--,
“<em class=rfc2119>MUST NOT</em>”,
“<em class=rfc2119>SHOULD</em>”, and “<em class=rfc2119>MAY</em>”
--> in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as
described in <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119>RFC 2119</a>.

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such
as “strip any leading space characters” or “return false and abort
these steps”) are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
(e.g. “<em class=rfc2119>MUST</em>”) used in introducing the
algorithm.

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
<em class=rfc2119>MAY</em> be implemented in any manner, so long as
the end result is equivalent.  (In particular, the algorithms defined
in this specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not
intended to be performant.)
